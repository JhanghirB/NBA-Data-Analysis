# NBA Data Analysis

NBA Data Analysis is a project that gathers, combines, and visualizes data related to NBA games, schedules, and team locations. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights across matchups and time.

---

## Data Sources

- `schedule.csv` - Game schedules (dates, times, etc.)  
- `locations.csv` - Venue or team location information  
- `team_game_data.csv` - Game-level data per team  
- Additional supporting files and templates (e.g. `schedule_24_partial.csv`, `.Rmd` report templates)

---

## Key Goals

- Merge and clean various CSV datasets to provide a unified view of NBA games and locations  
- Enable exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer questions such as:
  - Which venues host the most games?
  - How do team performance or schedule density vary over time?
  - What insights can be drawn about travel, scheduling impacts, or geographic distribution

## Tools and Workflow

- Primarily uses CSV files for raw data storage  
- Uses R Markdown (`.Rmd`) for report-style analysis, visualizations, and documentation  
- Focuses on reproducible analysis pipelines including cleaning, transformation, and visualization

## Use Case

This project is designed for sports analysts, fans, or data scientists interested in NBA trends. It can support visualization, research, or dashboard development by providing a structured and data-driven foundation for analyzing schedules, locations, and related metrics.
